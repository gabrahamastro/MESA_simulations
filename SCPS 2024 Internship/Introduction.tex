\section{Introduction}\label{sec:Intro}
This report aims to test the version of Models for Evolution in Stellar Astrophysics, {\tt MESA}, {\tt r24.03.1}, focusing on how \gls{TDC} and \gls{MLT}, referred to in figures as ``Cox'', affect the behaviour of simulations. To this end, it aims to indicated whether the evolution of a $20M_{\odot}$ star modelled using \gls{TDC} provides reliable results when compared to \gls{MLT}. 

This is motivated by how a drawback of \gls{MLT} is its assumption that evolutionary timescales are much longer than convective timescales, making the assumption that convective flux can be time averaged valid. This is, however, not a true assumption for late phases of evolution in massive stars, making time-independence and inappropriate assumption. 

Therefore, if an approximation to \gls{TDC} in 1D, using in the new \texttt{MESA} version provides reliable results (similar to \gls{MLT} at long timescales, when the above assumption is true), this would indicate modelling with \gls{TDC} could provide results closer to reality.
