\small{\textit{Acknowledgements.} I am grateful to the School of Chemical and Physical Sciences at Keele University for providing me with the opportunity to work in a research group and for the support they provided through a bursary. I also thank Raphael Hirschi for supervising me and providing a lot of guidance and support along the way, Vishnu Varma for greatly helping me to understand the literature and results whilst giving many suggestions of how to develop the project and Emily “Em” Whitehead for her help with coding and understanding the data. Lastly, I am thankful to all the physics post graduate researchers at Keele University for being so welcoming and for providing so much helpful advice along the way.
