    \caption{\gls{HRD} showing change in luminosity by surface temperature of four models from H-burning at $35\%$ core He, varying only by mixing theory and resolution (Fine = high resolution, Coarse = test run resolution). Important stages are labelled (where ZAMS = zero age main sequence; label location after \citealp{Maeder09}).}
