# Keele University SCPS Summer Internship 2024

## Introduction
For an internship at Keele University during Summer 2024, I was given the opportunity to use [MESA](https://docs.mesastar.org/) to simulate the evolution of 20 solar mass stars. The purpose was to investigate the effects of changing the convection theorem used (time-independent compared to time-dependent convection) in 1D using mixing length theory.

## Repository Contents
This repository contains the LaTeX files and output for the report I wrote detailing what I did during the internship. 

Please note, the work is licenced under the licence within the `LICENCE.md` file. However, there are works created by others, but these are referenced either within the main output file, `main.pdf`, or in their respective files (such as the bibliography style file `aa.bst`.

## Further Details
If you're interested in learning more, I've given two presentations ([one shorter](https://youtu.be/TeXpwEyD3O8), to students and researchers at Keele University, [and one longer](https://youtu.be/98_KHo6fLcY), to members of Altrincham and District Astronomical Society) both available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCemhlJi4JMCy_a6eJi0_kZQ).
